## ... Still interested in me?

Mort is a slow learner, a wannabe perfectionist, a born skeptic, a grotesque artist, a not-so-geeky geek, and yet an overwhelmed Computer Science student.

Mort is striving to learn mathematics and logic, presumably for a lifetime. Mort is also obsessed with all forms of visual arts, especially metaphysical art, monochrome photography, and (for practical reasons) graphic design, typography as well as data visualization.

Mort was born in Nanking, China and currently lives in Copenhagen, Denmark. He enjoys reading, cooking, solving puzzles, wandering in a library, hiking and urban exploring in his spare time, which he doesn't have so much for now.

Unsurprisingly, Mort is aware of a lot about what he doesn't know or has never experienced yet. Thus, his life journey goes on.

Mort is a man; all men are mortal. Hence the name. (self-referentially!)

## (Probably don't) follow me

The main entry point of my everything is on: [www.soimort.org](https://www.soimort.org/).

I'm currently active on [GitHub](https://github.com/soimort), Tumblr, Twitter ([public account](https://twitter.com/soimort)), Google+, 755, Douban and Wikipedia. If you find someone like me elsewhere on the Internet, either it's a stale account I no longer use regularly, or it's simply not me. My IRC handle is `soimort`, as expected.

My PGP fingerprint is [`07DA 00CB 7820 3251`](https://keybase.io/soimort/key.asc). You may also track my key on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/soimort). Of course, you'll have to meet me in person if you really need to make sure that this key belongs to the "right guy".

## Contact me

Email: <soi@mort.ninja>

Please understand that I read and reply my emails using a lazy evaluation strategy (namely "reply-by-need"). I apologize for (possibly) no response to your request.

I'm not a big fan of instant messaging now. Nirsh. Just give me a call, if you can.

Alternatively, I'm most happy to receive a postcard, or a real letter at:

```
Mort Xiaomo Yao
Kagså Kollegiet 157-9

Denmark
```
